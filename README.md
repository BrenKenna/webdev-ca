## Plan

Have a landing page where the user can then access their own profile and then the core content. Rational is to try to limit overloading the user with too much content. Logging-in and password resets are more to add aesthetic appeal to the website, and also superfluous to requirements, so their buttons will be artificial.

From the landing page the user can view their required content via links to specific tables. Each table page is a replicate with different table values & page title.

With the skeleton of website + some initial stylings, can then look at linking table content to each other where relevant.

Most to do work as this point is more towards simpler styling, and finalizing image X over Y. Ideally would use the viewport & media queries to handle small, medium and large devices particularly for text. But might not have time to cover this alongside: Positions, Layout left/right float, Semantic Design (header, nav, section etc), Transitions on Hovering, Overflow. Compensate this for % based styling where possible.

Insert any screenshots here???



## To Do List:

1. Flush stylings and update pages.
2. Finalize images for brand & icon for tables template.
3. Consistent color pallet for pages + text.
4. Table color stylings <= Less is more.

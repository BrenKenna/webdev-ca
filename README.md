## Plan

Have a landing page where the user can then access their own profile or the core content (ie tables). Rational is to try to limit overloading the user with too much content. Logging-in and password resets are more to add aesthetic appeal to the website, so their buttons will be artificial. Alternative is to place the apps "*hook*" in the box beside these links.

From the landing page the user can view their required content via links to specific tables. Each table page is a replicate with different table values & page title. The user should be able to jump between them easily. With the skeleton of the website + some initial stylings, can see what fits better for final version after linking table content to each other where relevant.

Most to do work as this point is more towards simpler styling, and finalizing image X over Y. Ideally would use the viewport & media queries to handle small, medium and large devices particularly for text. But might not have time to cover this alongside basics for HTML & CSS: Positions, Layout left / right float, Semantic Design (header, nav, section etc), Transitions on Hovering, Overflow. Compensate this for % based styling where possible.

Insert any screenshots here???



## To Do List:

1. Flush stylings and update pages.
2. 4 pages per table & link to each other.
3. Finalize images for brand & icon for tables template.
4. Consistent color pallet for pages + text.
5. Table color stylings <= Less is more.
